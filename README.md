# Semantic Search Learning Project

This project is a learning implementation of a **semantic search** system using Python.  
It demonstrates how to process and index text data, then perform intelligent searches using vector embeddings.

## Features
- Preprocessing and cleaning of input text
- Embedding generation using state-of-the-art models
- Cosine similarity for semantic matching
- Example queries and results
- Modular and beginner-friendly code structure

## Project Structure
- `main.py` → Main script to run the search
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies list
- `.env` → Environment variables (not committed for security)
- `venv/` → Python virtual environment (ignored in Git)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/semantic_search_learningproject.git


2. Navigate to the project folder:

    cd semantic_search_learningproject
    Create and activate a virtual environment:


3. python -m venv venv

# For Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Create a .env file and add your API keys or configurations.



## Usage
    Run the main script:
        python main.py

## Notes
    Make sure your .env file contains valid API credentials.
    This project is for learning purposes only.
    Sensitive files like .env are excluded from version control using .gitignore.
